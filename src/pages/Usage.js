        <p>
            The component library provides reusable UI elements and design tokens to maintain a consistent look and
            feel across the application. You can import components directly into your project and customize them using the 
            available props, colors, and typography variants. This allows for faster development, easier maintenance, 
            and a cohesive user interface.
